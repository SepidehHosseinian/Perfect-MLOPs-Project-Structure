•  Write detailed sections for each topic in your table of contents. You should provide clear and concise instructions on how to install, use, and contribute to your project. You should also explain the main features and functionalities of your project. You can use code blocks, screenshots, diagrams, or gifs to illustrate your points. For example:

## Installation
To use this cookiecutter template, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher and cookiecutter installed on your system. You can install cookiecutter using pip:

pip install cookiecutter

Then, you can create a new project using this template by running the following command:

cookiecutter https://github.com/SepidehHosseinian/Perfect-MLOPs-Project-Structure-Cookiecutter-readme.so.git

You will be prompted to enter some information about your project, such as the name, description, author, license, etc. After that, you will have a new directory with the name of your project that contains the following structure:

├── data
│   ├── external
│   ├── interim
│   ├── processed
│   └── raw
├── docs
├── models
├── notebooks
├── references
├── reports
│   └── figures
├── src
│   ├── data
│   ├── features

│   └── visualization
├── tests
├── .gitignore

## Usage
To use this project structure, you need to follow some conventions and best practices. Here are some guidelines:

•  Put your raw data in the data/raw directory and do not modify it. Use scripts in the src/data directory to process and clean your data and save the results in the data/processed directory.

•  Put your external data sources or references in the data/external directory and document their origin and format.

•  Put any intermediate data that has been transformed or generated in the data/interim directory and document their purpose and usage.

•  Put your Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory and name them with a number and a short description (e.g., 01_data_exploration.ipynb). Use notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualization only and do not include any core logic or functionality in them.

•  Put your machine learning models in the models directory and use scripts in the src/models directory to train, evaluate, and save them. Use tools like [DVC] or [MLflow] to track and version your models and their parameters.

•  Put your documentation in the docs directory and use tools like [Sphinx] or [MkDocs] to generate HTML pages from your Markdown or reStructuredText files.

•  Put your reports and figures in the reports directory and use tools like [Pandoc] or [LaTeX] to create PDF documents from your Markdown or reStructuredText files.

•  Put your source code in the src directory and organize it into subdirectories according to its functionality (e.g., src/data for data processing, src/features for feature engineering, src/models for model training, src/visualization for data visualization, etc.). Use descriptive and consistent names for your modules, classes, functions, and variables and follow the [PEP 8] style guide for Python code.

•  Put your tests in the tests directory and use tools like [pytest] or [unittest] to write and run unit tests for your code. Use tools like [coverage.py] or [codecov] to measure and report the code coverage of your tests.

•  Use the .gitignore file to exclude files and directories that are not relevant or necessary for your project (e.g., .ipynb_checkpoints, .vscode, __pycache__, etc.).

•  Use the .pre-commit-config.yaml file to configure pre-commit hooks that will check and format your code before committing it to Git. You can use tools like [black], [isort], [flake8], or [mypy] to automatically format and lint your code.

•  Use the LICENSE file to specify the license of your project and the terms and conditions for using and distributing it. You can choose a license from [choosealicense.com] or use tools like [licenser] or [license-generator] to generate a license file for your project.

•  Use the Makefile file to define commands and tasks that can be executed from the command line. For example, you can use make data to run the data processing scripts, make train to run the model training scripts, make test to run the tests, etc.

•  Use the README.md file to provide a comprehensive description of your project, its purpose, features, installation, usage, and contribution guidelines. You can use tools like [readme.so] or [Make a README] to create a README file for your project.

•  Use the requirements.txt file to list the dependencies and packages that are required to run your project. You can use tools like [pipreqs] or [pip-tools] to generate and manage a requirements file for your project.

## Features
This project structure provides some useful features that can help you with your machine learning workflow, such as:

•  Data versioning: You can use tools like DVC or MLflow to track and version your data files and directories. This way, you can reproduce your experiments with different data sets and compare the results.

•  Model tracking: You can use tools like DVC or MLflow to track and version your models and their parameters. This way, you can reproduce your experiments with different models and compare their performance.

•  Testing: You can use tools like pytest or unittest to write and run unit tests for your code. This way, you can ensure that your code is working correctly and avoid bugs and errors.

•  Logging: You can use tools like logging, loguru, or rich to add logging messages to your code. This way, you can monitor the progress and status of your experiments and debug any issues.

•  Documentation: You can use tools like Sphinx or MkDocs to generate HTML pages from your Markdown or reStructuredText files. This way, you can create a user-friendly documentation for your project that explains its purpose, features, installation, usage, etc.

•  Reporting: You can use tools like Pandoc or LaTeX to create PDF documents from your Markdown or reStructuredText files. This way, you can create a professional report for your project that summarizes its results, findings, conclusions, etc.
